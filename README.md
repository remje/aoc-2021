My tests for Advent of Code 2021

## Intentions
This year, I'm trying to up my game in test-driven-development, refactoring and MMMSS. I'll try to work on each problem in a branch, and create a commit for eeach modification. In a normal project, I would squash these commits but on this one I'll keep them as a tool to reflect on where I could have put more or less steps.
